    <h3>About Me</h3>
        
    <p>UPDATE: I am now using Google Drive to host my site. So, it now loads much
    quicker and nicer. Also, I just registered the domain www.james1002.tk which redirects
    to this site.</p>

    <p>Hi! I recently graduated from the University of the Pacific in Stockton,
    CA. Currently, I am searching for a position in the Electrical Engineering
    field and am open to moving pretty much anywhere.</p>

    <p>I enjoy playing video games such as Super Mario, Mario Kart, Zelda, etc,
    and some of my other hobbies include singing, playing the piano, and
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OgZoUzfUtw">flying
    kites.</a></p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src=
    "https://www.youtube.com/embed/-OgZoUzfUtw" width="560"></iframe>

    <p>I didn't add any music to this video for a couple of reasons.</p>

    <p></p>

    <ul>
      <li>First, I think that adding random music to a video is kind of
      pointless. It usually has no meaning at all.</li>

      <li>Second, if you listen closely, you can hear the sound of the kite as
      it swoopes down.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    <p></p>

    <p>Apart from those hobbies, I also really enjoy cooking and would love to
    open a food truck one day.</p>

    <p>For my day to day ramblings, please visit my blog <a href=
    "http://james1002.wordpress.com">here</a></p>

    <h3>Experience</h3>

    <p>This is pretty much the extent of my web developing skills, but I am
    working on them as well. If you would like to know more details about me,
    please take a look at my <a class='btn btn-success' href=
    'files/JamesLee_resume.pdf'>Resume</a> Then, feel free to email me,
    call/text me, or send me a message on facebook from the Contact
    section.</p>

      <h3>Something I Just Learned</h3>
      <p>So as I was browsing online, looking for a better way to host my website, I came across a 
      site that talked about how to utilize Google Drive to host your website. WHAT!? I know! So 
      basically how it works is<ol>
          <li>You create a folder.</li>
          <li>Change the sharing to Public on the Web</li>
          <li>Looking at the url (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B7L_2g6AwveidUM4TWJnQktFVGs) grab the part after the "folders" part.</li>
          <li>Essentially now, this folder acts as your root folder. If you go to www.googledrive.com/host/[your url part here], you will be up and running.</li>
      </ol></p>
  </div></div>

    <h3>Contact</h3>

    <p>As written above, I am currently looking for a full-time position in the
    Electrical Engineering field. If You have a position available or you would
    just like to get to know me better, please send me an email or check out my
    facebook page below.</p>
